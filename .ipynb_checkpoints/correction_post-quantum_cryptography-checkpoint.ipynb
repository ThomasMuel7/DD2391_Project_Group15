    "The General Number Field Sieve (GNFS) is the most efficient classical algorithm known for factoring large integers larger than $10^{100}$. Its history traces the evolution of computational number theory and reflects decades of research aimed at understanding the limits of public-key cryptography, particularly RSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The origins of the method go back to the 1980s, when John Pollard introduced the Number Field Sieve for a very special class of integers known as Cunningham numbers. Building on this idea, Arjen Lenstra, Hendrik Lenstra, Mark Manasse, and John Pollard generalized the approach in the early 1990s, creating the algorithm now known as the GNFS. This breakthrough provided, for the first time, a sub-exponential algorithm that could factor arbitrary large integers more efficiently than the Quadratic Sieve, which had been the previous state of the art.\n",
    "\n",
    "From that point forward, GNFS became the central tool in record-setting factorizations. In 1994, it was used to factor RSA-129, a 129-digit number (426 bits) made famous by Martin Gardner’s challenge in Scientific American. Over the following decades, GNFS was refined and scaled up through distributed computing efforts and advances in algorithm engineering. Notable milestones include the factorization of RSA-768 (232 digits) in 2009, RSA-240 (795 bits) in 2019, and RSA-250 in 2020. Each of these achievements pushed the limits of available hardware and demonstrated both the power of GNFS and the ongoing need to increase RSA key sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, GNFS remains the gold standard for classical integer factorization. Its history underscores the constant interplay between mathematical innovation and computational progress, and it provides the foundation for our understanding of how secure RSA remains in the face of classical attacks."

    "Imagine we're not just working with numbers anymore, but with a new kind of \"number plant\" that has sprouted from our polynomial. These \"number plants\" are called **algebraic numbers**, and they look like $a + b\\theta$. This is similar to how complex numbers are built: we introduce a symbol $i$ with $i^2 = -1$, and then form numbers of the type $a + bi$. So what is $\\theta$ in our case? It’s a special symbol we introduce to represent a root of our polynomial $f(x)$. For example, if $f(x) = x^2 - 2$, then $\\theta = \\sqrt{2}$ because $\\theta^2 = 2$. We don’t need to know $\\theta$ as a decimal; we just work with it symbolically, like we do with i. \n",

This clever trick lets us use something we know (our polynomial) to find and categorize these new \"algebraic primes.\"\n",

    "Each smooth pair $(a, b)$ is represented as a row vector containing the sign of $a + bm$, the exponents of its rational prime factors modulo 2, the exponents of the algebraic factors modulo 2, and any relevant quadratic characters. Stacking these vectors forms a $y \\times (1+k+l+u)$ matrix $X$. y is the number of smooth pairs collected hance the number of rows in the matrix. This matrix encodes all information necessary to combine smooth numbers into perfect squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation detail:** For each smooth pair $(a,b)$, a row vector is created. The first entry is a sign bit (0 for positive $a+bm$, 1 for negative). The next $k$ entries are the exponents of the primes in the rational factor base $R$ from the factorization of $a+bm$, taken modulo 2. The following $l$ entries are the exponents of the algebraic factors from the factorization of $a+b\\theta$, also modulo 2. Finally, the last $u$ entries are derived from the quadratic character base $Q$, representing whether the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{a+bs}{q}\\right)$ is 1 (entry 0) or -1 (entry 1). This vector essentially summarizes the parity of the exponents and the quadratic characters, which is a concise way to check for perfect squares.\n",

We then compute the integer value of the algebraic perfect square using the mapping $\\phi: \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$.

This creates the congruence of squares $x^2 \\equiv y^2 \\pmod n$ that can be used for factorization with a high probability of success. For example, in the case of $n=45113$, this process led to the discovery of factors 197 and 229.\n",

Experimental demonstrations have so far only managed to factor very small numbers, with the most reliable implementations handling integers such as **15** and **21**.  \n",

Factoring such a number is projected to require approximately **20 million physical qubits** when error correction overhead is considered. Even with algorithmic optimizations, the requirement is unlikely to fall below **one million physical qubits**. By contrast, the most advanced hardware currently available contains just over **1,000 qubits** (such as IBM’s *Condor* processor with **1,121 qubits**), underscoring the enormous gap between experimental capability and the resources required to compromise RSA in practice.  \n",

In addition, the total energy expenditure for such a computation has been estimated in the **tens of megawatt-hours**, comparable to the continuous operation of a small industrial facility.\n",
