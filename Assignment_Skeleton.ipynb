    "Before the 1970s, all cryptography relied on shared secret keys (symmetric encryption). But this raised a major problem: how could the secret key be exchanged securely if enemies were listening?\n",
    "In response to it, in 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published New Directions in Cryptography by introducing the idea of a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt so no need to secretly exchange keys in advance.\n",
    "Building on this, researchers realized that multiplying two large prime numbers was a simple task, whereas factoring their product back into its prime components was extremely difficult.\n",
    "This property, known as a “one-way function,” provided exactly the mathematical foundation needed for a secure encryption system. In 1977, Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman transformed this insight into a practical algorithm, which became known as RSA, named after their initials."

    "Estimates for breaking a **2048-bit RSA modulus** remain far beyond present technology. Factoring such a number is projected to require approximately **20 million physical qubits** when error correction overhead is considered. Even with algorithmic optimizations, the requirement is unlikely to fall below **one million physical qubits**. By contrast, the most advanced hardware currently available contains just over **1,000 qubits** (such as IBM’s *Condor* processor with **1,121 qubits**), underscoring the enormous gap between experimental capability and the resources required to compromise RSA in practice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit depth of Shor’s algorithm scales quadratically with the key size, and at this scale, execution would demand **trillions of sequential quantum gate operations**—orders of magnitude beyond the **coherence times of existing devices** (IBM's best hardware has a coherence time of **400 microseconds**). In addition, the total energy expenditure for such a computation has been estimated in the **tens of megawatt-hours**, comparable to the continuous operation of a small industrial facility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while RSA is theoretically vulnerable to quantum factorization, the hardware required to execute such an attack does not yet exist. Present-day quantum computers remain **millions of qubits** and several technological breakthroughs away from posing a realistic threat to widely used cryptographic key sizes."
